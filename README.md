# Off-Platform Project: RESTful Restaurants
Build an API to store and retrieve information about your favorite restaurants!

Introduction
In this off-platform project, you will be building an API to connect the front-end and back-end of a restaurant review site. 
This site will allow its users to view a list of saved restaurants, add to that list, star their favorite restaurants, and 
leave comments about these places. We’ve got you started by building the front-end and setting up some API routes for you. 
You’ll focus on adding the remaining routes needed to handle starred restaurants and comments.
